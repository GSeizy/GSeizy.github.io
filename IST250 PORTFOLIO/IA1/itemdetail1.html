        <h2>About this Guitar</h2>
        <p>
            The Gibson Les Paul Standard is the guitar in the middle of my collection. I've only had it about a year,
            and it truly plays like a dream. It was a bit of an impulse buy, and sadly, I don't get to play it as much
            as it deserves. This guitar needs mileage and a home where it will be played often.
        </p>

            I'm asking <strong>$2000</strong> for this guitar. I'm firm on the price, but feel free to throw a number
            out and we can talk!
