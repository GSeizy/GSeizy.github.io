                <h1>Welcome Aspiring PC Builders!</h1>
                <p class="lead">My name is Jake and I started PCBuilderBase to give beginners the knowledge necessary to
                    build their own PC from the ground up. Whether you are building for
                    everyday use or for serious gaming, you've come to the right place!</p>

            <h2>So You Might Ask, Why Build Your Own PC?</h2>
            <p>Building your own PC might seem intimidating at first, but it is actually much easier than you
                think.<br>If
                you have some determination, patience, and a sprinkle of mechanical inclination, then you have come to
                the right place.</p>
            <p>Here are some reasons why people choose to build their own:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Save $$$$</strong> - You often get equal (or better) performance for less than pre-built
                    costs.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Customization</strong> - With our guides, you can choose exactly what you need for your
                    personal use case. You're not bound to what the builder or manufacturer provides.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn Some Useful Skills</strong> - Understanding your PC components helps with
                    troubleshooting, understanding, and future upgrades/builds.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy to Upgrade</strong> - A few years go by and maybe your build isn't keeping up the way
                    it
                    used to, you'll know exactly what you need to do to get back on top.</li>
                <li><strong>Fun and Rewarding</strong> - From the first time you press the power button to
                    everything you do after, there is a satisfaction knowing you built that yourself.</li>
            </ul>
