            <p>Every PC is made up of several key parts, more commonly known as components.<br>Learning and
                understanding
                the function of each component will take you from beginner to pro.</p>

            <h2>The Essential Parts</h2>

            <div class="part-row">
                <div class="part-name">
                    <h3>The CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="part-desc">
                    <p>Quite literally, the CPU is the brain of your computer. It handles all the complex thinking and
                        math.
                        Depending on its clock speed, a typical CPU makes billions and
                        trillions of calculations per second... Yes, you read that right.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="part-row">
                <div class="part-name">
                    <h3>The CPU Cooler</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="part-desc">
                    <p>Your CPU generates a lot of heat when
                        it's working hard, and without proper cooling it will overheat and shut down to protect itself.
                        No CPU
                        means no PC. There
                        are two main types: First is air coolers (big heatsinks with fans) and liquid coolers (uses
                        water to
                        transfer
                        heat away). Regardless of your choice, both work quite well. Air coolers are simpler and
                        cheaper, while
                        liquid coolers can be quieter
                        and look cleaner. On the other hand, air coolers can be louder, and liquid coolers can
                        fail... use your
                        imagination there. Regardless take care of your PC and it will run well.</p>

                <div class="part-name">
                    <h3>Fans</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="part-desc">
                    <p>Sticking with the body analogy, fans are like lungs. They keep air flowing through the system.
                        Intake
                        fans inhale fresh, cool air for your PC to breathe and exhale hot air that is bad for it. Most
                        cases
                        come with one or
                        two fans, but adding more can improve temperatures and give you more customization options.</p>

                    <h3>The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="part-desc">
                    <p>This is the visual cortex of the PC. This takes all those CPU calculations and turns them into
                        the
                        conceivable information that is viewable to
                        your eyes.
                        Without
                        the GPU, it's just 1's, 0's, and a blank screen. This part is essential for gaming and video
                        editing.</p>

                <div class="part-name">
                    <h3>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="part-desc">
                    <p>This is your PC's short term memory. The job of RAM is to temporarily store
                        the information of whatever you're actively working on and then send it back to storage when
                        you're
                        done. It makes it so your computer runs faster and more efficiently. The more RAM you have, the
                        more you
                        can have open at once. If the main PC storage is the vault
                        in a bank, the RAM is a safety deposit box. Essentially, it
                        gets pulled when you need it, and it stays safely tucked away when you don't.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="part-row">
                <div class="part-name">
                    <h3>Storage</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="part-desc">
                    <p>This is your PC's long term memory. It is where everything you store on your computer lives.
                        Download
                        an app? Goes to Storage. Upload and save an image? Goes to Storage. There are two types, SSD
                        (Solid
                        State Drive) and HDD (Hard Disk Drive). SSD is a solid, non-moving form of storage that is more
                        reliable. HDD is kind of like a CD. It spins at thousands of RPMs and reads the storage
                        electromagnetically. Both are slower than RAM and act as a long-term
                        parking spot for anything on your PC. When you need it, RAM goes and grabs it for you to use
                        smoothly,
                        and then it goes back when you're done. Ever notice how the first time you open an application
                        after a
                        while, it can be slow to start? That's because the RAM has to go get it again.</p>

                    <h3>The PSU (Power Supply Unit)</h3>

                <div class="part-desc">
                    <p>The beating heart of the PC. It does exactly what it says. It supplies power to the entire PC and
                        without
                        it,
                        nothing runs. In most cases, it just looks like a small box
                        with a cooling fan that vents out of the back of the PC. Next to that fan will be where your
                        electricity
                        supply (the wall power cord) will go. On one of the other sides are multiple leads that go to
                        various
                        parts
                        of the pc to deliver power. I'd recommend choosing this wisely. The formula typically goes: more
                        expensive
                        part = more power needed. Not enough power means the PC won't run. Buy a cheap one that doesn't
                        have
                        good failsafes and the PC becomes prone to crashing, freezing, and or permanent damage.</p>

                <div class="part-desc">
                    <p>This part acts as the main connector for everything. How does your brain know that your foot is
                        itchy?
                        Because
                        your nervous system runs all throughout your body and connects back up to your brain via the
                        spinal cord
                        (little anatomy lesson for you there.) The motherboard (spinal cord) holds every component
                        together and
                        tells the CPU (the brain) what they're doing every single nanosecond. The countless array of
                        transistors
                        and wires (nervous system) deliver the info to and from to accomplish this. Always make sure
                        it's
                        compatible with your
                        CPU choice, RAM amount, and other connections you may prefer.</p>

                <div class="part-desc">
                    <p>Finally, we have this case and this acts as the body. Just like how everything that makes you up
                        is
                        enclosed in your body; everything that makes up your PC is enclosed in its case. Be careful to
                        pick one
                        that fits your motherboard size, has good
                        airflow, and room for the rest of your parts. Trust me on that, you don't want to get it all
                        unboxed and
                        assembled just to realize your GPU is too big to fit.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Magnetic Phillips Screwdriver Set</u> - Many screws in a PC are very small so a kit with
                            #0, #1, and #2
                            phillips heads are recommended. A magnetic screw head is also incredibly useful and time
                            saving as you will drop your screws countless times otherwise.</li>
                        <li><u>Anti-Static Wrist Strap</u> - This helps to ground any electricity on your person. One
                            small shock at the wrong time can fry components.</li>
                        <li><u>Zip Ties or Velcro Cord Straps</u> - Crucial for good cable management. Trust me, you
                            don't want cables everywhere!</li>
                        <li><u>Small Flashlight</u> - Even in a well lit room, you're still working in a dark PC case.
                            It gets hard to see.</li>
                        <li><u>Thermal Paste</u> - Not always necessary as some CPU Coolers come pre-applied, but good
                            to have
                            if necessary.</li>
                        <li><u>USB Drive with Windows</u> - All of your efforts will be for nothing if you don't have
                            this.
