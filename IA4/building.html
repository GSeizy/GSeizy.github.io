                        <p>A good workspace environment is clean, dust free, has good lighting, and a smooth, flat
                            surface
                            to work on. Remove the left, right, and front plates of your case.</p>

                                This is a generalized guide. Your individual component manuals may have certain
                                recommendations or requirements as all manufacturers are different.)</em></p>

                        <p>On your motherboard, locate the CPU socket. Open the bracket, align the CPU chip with the
                            corresponding markers and gently place the chip in. <strong>DO NOT FORCE IT.</strong> CPU's
                            are very fragile devices and
                            if you bend the contact pins, it's over. Gently close the bracket back over the CPU until

                            hear a light click

                            pattern. Apply slowly and carefully but don't cake it on. Mount the cooler over top of the

                        <p>If you've correctly chosen a compatible motherboard, your RAM choice should line up nicely.
                            Locate the RAM slots on the motherboard, open the clips, and gently insert the RAM sticks
                            with
                            light to medium pressure until the clips spring back. This will lock the sticks into place.

                        <p>If your case didn't come with enough fans or your preference is to add extras, now is the
                            best
                            time. Mount intake fans at the front and exhaust fans at the back or top. This keeps air
                            flowing clean and in one
                            direction so heat doesn't get trapped. It's easier to do this step now before the case

                        <p>First and foremost, install the I/O shield in the back of the case. Once that is done, line
                            up
                            the motherboard with the standoffs (the threaded holes for the screws) and gently fasten

                            together.
                            Make sure they reach their proper connectors before you tighten them together so you don't

                            may not have one included. If the GPU is too heavy for the motherboard, this can cause
                            flexing
